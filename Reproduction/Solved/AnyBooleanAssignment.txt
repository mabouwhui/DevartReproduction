Reproduction path for malformed SQL when filtering on an .any() boolean setter:
- Open the solution DevartReproduction.sln in Visual Studio 2019
- On an Oracle database: execute the script from the project in Database\Devart_repro_carmodel.sql
- Open Startup.cs and fill in the valid connection string in line 30 ( ConfigureServices() )
- Press run (F5) and wait for the default URL to open
- add an oData filter that filters on the HasModels property (this can also be reproduced by adding a linq filter on this property where we filter on HasModels property): 
	/DevartReproduction?$filter=HasModels eq true
Expected:
- valid JSON with cars data from the database is returned where the filter has been applied (eg. all cars (FORD and BMW) are returned).
Actual:
- code breaks with exception about invalid SQL "ORA-00933: SQL command not properly ended"
